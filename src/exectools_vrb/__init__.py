# exectools_vrb

Various tools to execute functions in python.

This module defines:

```function try_run()```
  
Exception proof function call. If the call succeeds, return the result of func.
If not, repeat the call under certain circumstances instead of raising an
exception immediately. Can be used if exceptions are expected, e.g. TimeoutErrors.

```type TryRunLogFunc```
  
Function type for logging exceptions to be used with in try_run(). 

```class TaskOnRequestThread```

Thread class which carries out a task (spefified by a callback
function) whenever it is requested to do so (by setting a flag).
There's also a method which will run this task periodically.

""" Function type for logging exceptions to be used with try_run().

           run_count: int, exc: BaseException) -> None

Args:
    func_name (str): name of function in which the exception occurred
    func_args (tuple[Any]): positional arguments to the function called.
    func_kwargs (dict[str, Any]): keyword arguments to the function called
    run_count (int): number of the current execution attempt

    If not, repeat the call under certain circumstances instead of raising an
    exception immediately. Can be used if exceptions are expected, e.g. TimeoutErrors.
   
    If func has positional and/or keyword arguments, use partial from functools.

    Args:
        func (Callable): function to be called, may be a partial function
        count (int, optional): max. number of attempts before giving up. 
            If count is less than 1, exactly one call is made. Defaults to 2.
        delay (float, optional): delay in seconds between two calls. Defaults to 1.0 
        retry_exc_types (list|None, optional): list of "allowed" exception types for a retry. 
            Defaults to [BaseException] ( = any exception allowed)
        logfunc (LogFunc|None, optional): log function to log "allowed" errors. e.g. as warnings. Defaults to None.

    Returns:
        Any: return value of func

    Examples:
    1) function with no arguments at all
    try_run(myfunc, 4)
    Resulting call: myfunc(), max. 4 attempts

    2) function with two pos. arguments
    try_run(partial(myfunc, "Hello", "World"), delay=5)
    Resulting call: myfunc("Hello", "World"), delay of 5 seconds
    
    3) function with one pos. argument and one keyword argument
    try_run(partial(myfunc, "Hello", message="World"), logfunc=logexc)
    Resulting call: myfunc("Hello", message="World"), call logexc in case of an exception

    4) function with keyword arguments only
    try_run(partial(myfunc, s1="Hello", s2="World"), retry_exc_types=[TimeoutError])
    Resulting call: myfunc(s1="Hello", s2="World"), retry only in case of TimeoutError
    
    If an exception occurs during the first count-1 tries, test if it's type (or one of
    its supertypes) is in retry_exc_types.

    If yes: call logfunc (if given) and repeat the call. The parameters to logfunc will be 
    - the name of the function called, its positional args (tuple) and keyword args (dict)
    - the run count,
    - the exception that has occurred. 

    Otherwise: reraise the exception.

    If there's any exception at the last try, it will not be caught.
